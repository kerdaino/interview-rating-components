## Overview

The challenge is to build out the interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge and give thanks to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit for their divine guidance, wisdom, and grace that have been instrumental in the success of this coding project. Without their constant presence and inspiration, this achievement would not have been possible.

Biblical Motivation:

I leave you with the words of Proverbs 3:5-6:

"Trust in the Lord with all your heart
and lean not on your own understanding;
in all your ways submit to him,
and he will make your paths straight."

May these words remind you that with faith, perseverance, and trust in God, you can overcome any challenge and achieve great things in His name. Keep moving forward, knowing that He is with you every step of the way.
